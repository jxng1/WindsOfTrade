M&amp;B: Bannerlord mod to improve the trading experience.

I took inspiration from the mod [The Color of Profits](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/4660) by [NexusLex27](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NexusLex27?gameId=3174), so I have to give a lot of credit to them!

Future changes may include:
- Reworking the trade rumour system, as I find it severely lacking.
- Improving UI/UX related to trade, to stop users from being confused with how trade prices work throughout Calradia - one example is that when a item's price is highlighted in red is when the price is more than usual, but it's not intuitive.
- Improve the trading mechanics, to allow more complex consequences of trade to cities and/or factions rather than a simple buy-sell format.
